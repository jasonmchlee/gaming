    "In this game the user will travel into the world of Star Wars, this game will follow the journey you choose to follow in your quest to save the galaxy. Going through each step the player will begin by selecting to partner MASTER YODA or LUKE SKYWALKER. They are both experienced Jedi Knights who have different enemies. You are on your quest to defeat the bad buys known as the dark side led by either DARTH VADER or SITH LORD. The player will go through 2 rounds to fight the enemy. Depending on the outcome of the battle, the player will be given an opportunity to extend the game and enter additional 2 rounds of Jedi training. The training will consists of random generated questions and index slicing obstacles that the player must complete. After successful/failed completion of the game the player will be provided with the final outcome of their efforts.\n",
